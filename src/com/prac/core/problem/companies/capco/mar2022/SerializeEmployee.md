To implement **serialization** on the `Employee` object, you need to make the `Employee` class implement the `Serializable` interface. This interface is a marker interface that tells the Java runtime that objects of this class can be serialized (converted into a byte stream) and deserialized (reconstructed from a byte stream).

Here's how you can implement **serialization** for an `Employee` class with the fields `Id`, `Name`, and `Address`.

### 1. **Make the `Employee` class implement `Serializable`**:
The `Employee` class needs to implement `Serializable`, and the fields in the class should be serializable as well.

### 2. **Create the `Address` class**:
The `Address` class also needs to be serializable, because it is a part of the `Employee` object.

### Example Code:

#### `Address` class (nested class for simplicity):
```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Address implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;  // To ensure version compatibility during serialization

    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String state;

    // Constructor
    public Address(String street, String city, String state) {
        this.street = street;
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public String getStreet() {
        return street;
    }

    public void setStreet(String street) {
        this.street = street;
    }

    public String getCity() {
        return city;
    }

    public void setCity(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public void setState(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return street + ", " + city + ", " + state;
    }
}
```

#### `Employee` class with `Serializable` interface:
```java
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Employee implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;  // Ensures version compatibility during serialization

    private int id;
    private String name;
    private Address address;

    // Constructor
    public Employee(int id, String name, Address address) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Address getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    public void setAddress(Address address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{id=" + id + ", name='" + name + "', address=" + address + "}";
    }
}
```

#### Serialization and Deserialization Example:
To serialize and deserialize the `Employee` object, we will use `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream`.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class EmployeeSerializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create Employee and Address objects
        Address address = new Address("1234 Main St", "Springfield", "IL");
        Employee employee = new Employee(1, "John Doe", address);

        // Serialize the Employee object
        try (ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("employee.ser"))) {
            out.writeObject(employee);
            System.out.println("Employee object serialized successfully.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Deserialize the Employee object
        try (ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("employee.ser"))) {
            Employee deserializedEmployee = (Employee) in.readObject();
            System.out.println("Deserialized Employee: " + deserializedEmployee);
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Serializable Interface**: Both the `Employee` and `Address` classes implement `Serializable`. This makes them serializable and ensures their data can be converted to a byte stream and vice versa.

2. **`serialVersionUID`**:
    - It's a unique identifier that ensures version compatibility between serialized and deserialized objects. It’s optional but recommended. If the class definition changes (fields are added or removed), using the same `serialVersionUID` ensures that the object can still be deserialized correctly.

3. **Serialization**:
    - We use `ObjectOutputStream` to write the `Employee` object into a file (`employee.ser`).
    - The `writeObject()` method is used to serialize the `Employee` object.

4. **Deserialization**:
    - We use `ObjectInputStream` to read the `Employee` object from the file.
    - The `readObject()` method is used to deserialize the object and return it as an `Employee` object.

### Points to Remember:
1. If you don’t want a specific field to be serialized, you can mark it as `transient`. This will prevent the field from being serialized.

   Example:
   ```java
   private transient String temporaryData;  // This will not be serialized.
   ```

2. Both the `Employee` and `Address` classes need to implement `Serializable` for the entire object to be serializable. If the `Address` class doesn’t implement `Serializable`, you will get a `java.io.NotSerializableException`.

### TL;DR:
To implement serialization on the `Employee` object, make sure the class implements the `Serializable` interface, and ensure that all member variables are serializable as well (e.g., the `Address` class should also implement `Serializable`). Serialize the object using `ObjectOutputStream` and deserialize using `ObjectInputStream`.
