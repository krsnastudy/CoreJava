The compilation and runtime behavior in this scenario depend on the specific errors present in **ClassA** and **ClassB**. Let's break it down.

1. **Compile-Time Error in ClassA**: If **ClassA** has a compile-time error, such as a syntax error or any other issue that prevents it from compiling, then the code will **not compile** at all.
    - This is because the Java compiler cannot proceed to check or compile **ClassB** if **ClassA** itself has errors.

2. **Runtime Error in ClassB**: If **ClassA** compiles successfully but **ClassB** has a runtime error, the **code will compile**, but when executed, it will throw an exception at runtime.

### Example:

Let's assume we have the following code:

```java
class ClassA {
    // Compile-time error in ClassA
    public void methodA() {
        // Missing closing parenthesis for method
        System.out.println("Hello);
    }
}

class ClassB extends ClassA {
    // Runtime error in ClassB
    public void methodB() {
        int[] arr = new int[5];
        System.out.println(arr[10]);  // This will cause ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime
    }
}
```

### Outcome:
1. **ClassA has a compile-time error** (missing closing quote in `System.out.println("Hello)`), so the **code will not compile** at all.
2. If the error in **ClassA** is fixed and the code compiles successfully, **ClassB** will compile, but it will throw a **runtime exception** (`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`) when executed.

### TL;DR:
- If **ClassA** has a compile-time error, the entire code will **not compile**.
- If **ClassA** compiles successfully but **ClassB** has a runtime error, the code **will compile**, but **ClassB** will throw an exception when executed.
