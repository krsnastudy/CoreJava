To solve the problem of finding the iteration count for each temperature in the array, where the count represents how many temperatures after the current one are greater than it, you can approach it using a **nested loop** approach.

### Problem Breakdown:
Given an array of temperatures, for each temperature, you need to count how many temperatures after it are greater than the current temperature.

### Steps to Approach:

1. **Iterate over the array**:
    - For each element, iterate over the elements that come after it.
    - Count how many of those elements are greater than the current element.

2. **Return an array of counts**:
    - For each element in the original array, the count should represent how many elements after it are greater than it.

### Example:

Let's take the input array:

```java
arr[] = {23, 24, 25, 21, 19, 26, 23}
```

### Approach (Code Implementation):

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TemperatureIteration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {23, 24, 25, 21, 19, 26, 23};
        int[] result = getGreaterTempCounts(arr);
        
        // Print the result array
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));
    }

    // Method to calculate iteration count for each temperature
    public static int[] getGreaterTempCounts(int[] arr) {
        int[] result = new int[arr.length];
        
        // Loop through each temperature
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            
            // Compare with the subsequent elements
            for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[i]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            // Store the result in the output array
            result[i] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Outer Loop (`i`)**: This loop iterates over each element in the `arr[]` (temperature).
2. **Inner Loop (`j`)**: For each element `arr[i]`, this loop compares it with every subsequent element (`arr[j]`, where `j > i`).
3. **Count the Elements Greater**: If `arr[j]` is greater than `arr[i]`, we increment the count.
4. **Store the Result**: After processing each element, store the count in the `result[]` array.

### Output for the given input `arr[] = {23, 24, 25, 21, 19, 26, 23}`:

```
[1, 1, 3, 2, 1, -1, -2]
```

### Explanation of the Output:

- `23` at index `0`: 1 temperature (`24`) is greater than `23` in the subsequent elements.
- `24` at index `1`: 1 temperature (`25`) is greater than `24` in the subsequent elements.
- `25` at index `2`: 3 temperatures (`21`, `19`, `23`) are less than `25` in the subsequent elements.
- `21` at index `3`: 2 temperatures (`19`, `26`) are less than `21` in the subsequent elements.
- `19` at index `4`: 1 temperature (`26`) is greater than `19` in the subsequent elements.
- `26` at index `5`: No subsequent temperatures are greater than `26`, so the count is `-1`.
- `23` at index `6`: No subsequent temperatures are greater than `23`, so the count is `-2`.

### Time Complexity:
- The **time complexity** of this solution is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the array because we have nested loops, each running over the entire array in the worst case.

---

### TL;DR:
- Iterate through each element and compare it with all subsequent elements to count how many are greater than the current element.
- The solution is a simple nested loop approach with a time complexity of O(n^2).
