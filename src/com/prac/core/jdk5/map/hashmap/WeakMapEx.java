/*
WeakHashMap

WeakHashMap is an implementation of the Map interface. 
WeakHashMap is almost same as HashMap except in case of WeakHashMap, 
if object is specified as key doesnâ€™t contain any references - 
it is eligible for garbage collection even though it is associated with WeakHashMap. 
i.e Garbage Collector dominates over WeakHashMap.
